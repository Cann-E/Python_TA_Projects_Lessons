# We need a program to determine the salary for Full-Time or Hourly Employees
# There will be two functions, one for full-time and one for hourly in a separate file

# The hourly function will accept hours worked. With a rate of 25 per hour
# Multiply their hours worked with rate, then return the value

# The full-time function will accept exp, for years worked. They have an annual pay of 25000
# if they worked from 2 - 4 years, they get a 1.5x raise and a bonus of 500
# if they worked from 4 - 10 years, they get a 2x raise and a bonus of 1000
# if they worked over 10 years, they get a 3x raise and bonus of 1500
# Anything else, they do not get a raise, their bonus is 200

# In the main program, create a loop to start and quit the program
# Every time it runs, it'll ask for an employee name and type (salary or hourly)
# if type = hourly, ask for number of hours worked and use the hourly function in a variable
# if type = salary, ask for years worked and use the full-time function in a variable
# Anything else, print off "You are unemployed!"
# At the loop end, print off the employees' name and their pay rate
