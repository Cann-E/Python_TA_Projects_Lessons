# BONUS CHALLENGE
# Create a function that takes a list as a parameter. If the list is 0, then return None. Otherwise, the function calculates the average of the numbers from the list.

# Create a loop to run the length of your list.

# Generate a new list every time the loop runs with the current index of your list.
# NOTE: We havenâ€™t studied this. Here is your clue:
# sublist = numbers_list[:i+1]

# Call your function and give it the sublist.

# Print off the average grade of the sublist.

# NOTE: Every time the loop runs, it updates the average grade and your list with the next number.



numbers_list=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
